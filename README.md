# Career-Diary-A-Web-based-Job-Application-Tracker
**Introduction**

Career Diary is a backend system designed to help users track and manage their job applications efficiently. It provides a secure, scalable, and structured API for managing job postings, application statuses, and user authentication. The project was built with real-world workflows in mind, focusing on clean API design and data integrity.

**üèóProject Architecture**

Backend Framework: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MySQL (with Sequelize ORM for queries & schema handling)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Token) for secure login & role-based access

Password Security: Bcrypt for hashing user credentials

Environment Config: dotenv for secure environment variable management

API Testing: Postman for endpoint testing and debugging

**Flow of the Application**

User Registration/Login ‚Äì Users register securely and log in using JWT authentication.

Job Application Management ‚Äì Users can create, update, or delete job applications.

Application Status Tracking ‚Äì Update status (applied, interview scheduled, offer, rejected, etc.) to monitor progress.

Secure Access ‚Äì Role-based access ensures only authorized users can manage data.

Data Persistence ‚Äì All information is stored in a structured relational database.

**Skills Demonstrated**

Backend Development: Built RESTful APIs using Node.js & Express.

Database Management: Designed normalized schemas and queries with Sequelize + MySQL.

Authentication & Security: Implemented JWT-based login and bcrypt for password security.

Error Handling: Centralized error management and validation for clean API responses.
